## Communication Protocol

### CH9329 Protocol

This firmware implements the **CH9329 communication protocol**, which is compatible with the WCH CH9329 chipset used in the original Openterface MiniKVM. By emulating the CH9329 protocol, this firmware provides backward compatibility with the software of first generation MiniKVM, allowing seamless operation with the same command structure and interface that the original CH9329 hardware provided.

**Key Benefits**:
- Full backward compatibility with original Openterface MiniKVM systems
- Standardized command structure for keyboard and mouse control
- Built-in error checking and command validation
- Seamless integration with existing KVM infrastructure

## Prerequisites

Before compiling, ensure you have the following:

- **WCH MounRiver Studio** (Windows, recommended): includes the RISC-V toolchain and one-click flash support.
- **xpack riscv-none-elf-gcc** (macOS / Linux): see [macOS build guide](docs/build-on-mac.md).
- **GNU Make** (`brew install make` on macOS).
- **Git** (for cloning the repository).

> The build system uses the `riscv-none-embed-gcc` wrapper name.  
> On macOS the [xpack toolchain](docs/build-on-mac.md) provides wrapper scripts that translate the WCH-specific `-march=rv32imacxw` flag to the standard `-march=rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei` automatically.

## How to Compile

### Using WCH MounRiver Studio (Windows, recommended)

1. **Open the project**: `File` → `Open Projects from File System` → select the `Openterface_KM` directory.
2. **Build**: right-click the project → `Build Project`.  
   The binary is placed in `build/openterface-km-firmware.elf`.

### Command Line (macOS / Linux)

See [docs/build-on-mac.md](docs/build-on-mac.md) for full toolchain setup.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/tools/xpack-riscv/wrappers:$PATH"
cd build
make clean && make all
```

Build output:

```
build/openterface-km-firmware.bin   ← flash this
build/openterface-km-firmware.elf   ← debug symbol file
```

### Build Flags

All flags are set via `make` variables and default to **on**.  
Pass them on the command line to override, e.g. `make ENABLE_BLE=0`.

#### `ENABLE_UAC` — USB Audio Class

```bash
make all ENABLE_UAC=0   # strip UAC, frees EP5 + EP6 on the USB controller
```

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `1` (default) | UAC microphone/speaker interface included |
| `0` | UAC descriptors and endpoints removed; USB device re-enumerates without audio |

#### `ENABLE_BLE` — Bluetooth Low Energy

```bash
make all ENABLE_BLE=0   # strip BLE entirely, frees ~7 KB static RAM (BSS)
```

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `1` (default) | BLE stack linked, BLE task runs alongside USB HID |
| `0` | BLE source files excluded, `-lwchble` not linked; FLASH drops from ~43% to ~8% |

When `ENABLE_BLE=1` the following BLE parameters can also be tuned:

| Variable | Default | Minimum | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BLE_MEMHEAP_SIZE` | `6144` | `6144` | Bytes of static RAM given to the BLE stack heap |
| `BLE_BUFF_MAX_LEN` | `64` | `27` | Max HCI packet payload (ATT_MTU = value − 4) |
| `BLE_TX_NUM_EVENT` | `1` | `1` | Max TX packets per connection event |

Examples:

```bash
# Larger MTU for faster BLE throughput (costs more heap RAM)
make all BLE_MEMHEAP_SIZE=8192 BLE_BUFF_MAX_LEN=128

# Minimal BLE — keyboard/mouse only, minimum RAM
make all BLE_MEMHEAP_SIZE=6144 BLE_BUFF_MAX_LEN=64 BLE_TX_NUM_EVENT=1
```

#### Combining flags

```bash
# USB-only build (no BLE, no UAC) — smallest image, maximum free RAM
make all ENABLE_BLE=0 ENABLE_UAC=0

```

### Memory Usage Summary

| Build configuration | FLASH | Static RAM (BSS+DATA) |
|---|---|---|
| BLE=1, UAC=1 (default) | 42.65% | 38 KB |
| BLE=1, UAC=0 | ~42% | 38 KB |
| BLE=0, UAC=1 | 8.05% | 29 KB |
| BLE=0, UAC=0 | ~7.7% | 29 KB |

> **RAM note**: the linker script fills remaining RAM with the stack region, so the linker always reports 100%. The relevant numbers are the BSS+DATA figures in the table above. With BLE=1 default settings there is ~27 KB available for stack at runtime.

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

1. **Compiler not found**
   ```bash
   which riscv-none-embed-gcc
   ```
   If missing, follow [docs/build-on-mac.md](docs/build-on-mac.md).

2. **Permission errors in the build directory**
   ```bash
   chmod -R u+w build/
   ```

3. **Stale object files**
   ```bash
   make clean && make all
   ```

4. **`BLE_LibInit` fails at runtime** (BLE=1, device hangs on boot)
   Increase the heap: `make all BLE_MEMHEAP_SIZE=8192`.

## How to Flash to Device

### Prerequisites

You’ll need the target device’s USB port connected to your computer 
(no external WCH-LinkE/LinkV programmer required). The flashing tool is WCHISPStudio

### Using WCHISPStudio

1. **Connect the device**:
   - Plug the device into your computer via the USB port
   - Ensure the device enters its built-in bootloader or USB-ISP mode (if required by your hardware design)

2. **Open WCHISPStudio**:
   - Launch the WCHISPStudio application (provided by WCH Nanjing Qinheng Microelectronics)
   - The tool should detect the target device connected via USB

3. **Flash the firmware**:
   - Load the binary file: `build/openterface-km-firmware.bin`
   - Ensure the correct MCU is selected: **CH32V208**
   - Click the **Download** or **Program** button
   - Wait for the operation to complete successfully
   - You should see a success message indicating the flash is complete

### Using WCH MounRiver Studio Built-in Flash Tool (Alternative)

If using WCH MounRiver Studio:

1. **Build the project** (as described in "How to Compile" section)
2. **Configure the debugger**:
   - Connect device via USB
   - Ensure the device is connected to the target
3. **Flash the firmware**:
   - Click the **Debug** or **Run** button in the toolbar
   - The firmware will be automatically compiled and flashed
   - Check the Console for completion status

### Verification

After flashing:

1. The device should enumerate as a USB device on your computer
2. Check system logs to confirm successful connection:
   - **Windows**: Device Manager → Ports (COM & LPT) or Human Interface Devices
   - **macOS**: `system_profiler SPUSBDataType`
   - **Linux**: `lsusb`

3. The RGB LED should indicate the device status:
   - Startup sequence animation
   - Steady light for normal operation
   - Different patterns for BLE/USB modes

## Configuration

### Feature flags

See the [Build Flags](#build-flags) section above for `ENABLE_BLE` and `ENABLE_UAC`.

For compile-time BLE tuning that is not exposed as a `make` variable, edit `HAL/include/config.h`:

```c
#define HAL_SLEEP          FALSE   // Enable BLE sleep/low-power mode
#define TEM_SAMPLE         TRUE    // RF calibration via temperature sensor
#define BLE_CALIBRATION_ENABLE TRUE // Periodic BLE clock calibration (every 120 s)
#define PERIPHERAL_MAX_CONNECTION 1 // Max simultaneous BLE peripheral connections
#define CENTRAL_MAX_CONNECTION    0 // Central role disabled (saves heap RAM)
```

## Development Environment

This project uses:
- **IDE**: MCUEclipse or Eclipse CDT
- **Toolchain**: GNU MCU Eclipse RISC-V Embedded GCC
- **Target MCU**: WCH CH32V208 (RISC-V ISA)

## Integration with Openterface KVM

The Openterface KVM series (KVMGo and MiniKVM v2) is a KVM-over-USB controller that enables direct access to target computers. This firmware provides the device-side component that translates Openterface KVM controller input commands into HID keyboard and mouse events on the target system.

### How It Works

The firmware bridges the Openterface KVM controller with the target system:

1. **Receives Commands**: Accepts keyboard and mouse input commands from the Openterface KVM controller via USB or BLE
2. **Emulates HID Devices**: Presents itself as a standard USB keyboard and mouse to the target operating system
3. **Translates Input**: Converts command protocols into HID reports that the target OS understands
4. **Flexible Connectivity**: Supports both direct USB and wireless BLE connections(Only supports keyboard and mouse parts)

### System Architecture

```

        ↓ 
    USB HID: Keyboard + Mouse
        ↓
    Target System (Windows/macOS/Linux)
```

This firmware runs on a device attached to the target machine, allowing the Openterface KVM controller to control the target system as if it were a local keyboard and mouse.
